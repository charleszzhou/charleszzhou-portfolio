        Pressure-Feedback Buoyancy Control for Underwater Depth Measurement
      </p>

      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Designed and built an autonomous submersible robot for underwater depth measurement in cliff-diving environments. 
        The system uses pressure-feedback-based buoyancy control to autonomously descend, detect the bottom, and resurface while maintaining stability in a highly nonlinear fluid environment. 
        Sensor data and images are logged onboard and transmitted wirelessly after resurfacing. The vehicle was validated to a depth of 17 ft and awarded Most Technical Project.
      </p>

      <h2>Problem & Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        Cliff-diving safety requires reliable depth information in locations where visibility is poor and manual measurement is unsafe. 
        The system needed to operate untethered, survive repeated submersion, maintain stable buoyancy control under nonlinear hydrodynamic effects, 
        and reliably recover data without requiring continuous underwater communication.
      </p>

      <h2>System Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The robot consists of a sealed pressure-rated housing containing an embedded control system, pressure and temperature sensors, onboard data storage, 
        and a syringe-pump-driven buoyancy bladder. 
        An ESP32 microcontroller coordinates sensing, closed-loop control, mission logic, data logging, and post-mission wireless communication upon resurfacing.
      </p>

      <h2>Autonomous Operation Sequence</h2>
      <p>
        1. Robot is deployed at the water surface and autonomous descent is triggered via wifi (phone).
        2. Pressure feedback is used to regulate buoyancy via closed-loop control.
        3. Bottom contact is detected using stabilized pressure readings.
        4. Buoyancy is reversed to initiate ascent.
        5. Upon resurfacing, collected depth, temperature, and image data is transmitted wirelessly.
      </p>

      <h2>Control & Sensing</h2>
      <p>
        Vertical motion is regulated using a closed-loop PID controller driven by pressure sensor feedback. 
        Pressure readings are converted to depth via the static water column relationship, enabling robust depth estimation independent of visual conditions. 
        Control gains were tuned to balance response speed with stability in the presence of fluid nonlinearities and sensor noise.
      </p>

      <h2>Mechanical & Electrical Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        Buoyancy control is achieved using a syringe-pump-driven bladder system, allowing precise volumetric adjustment without external thrusters. 
        The housing was fabricated from vacuum-formed PETG with epoxy-sealed bulkheads to ensure waterproofing under repeated submersion. 
        Electronics were modularized to simplify integration, sealing, and debugging.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Handling & Telemetry</h2>
      <p>
        All sensor measurements and images are logged locally during the mission. 
        Wireless communication is enabled only after resurfacing, ensuring reliable data recovery without requiring live underwater telemetry or continuous connectivity.
      </p>

      <h2>Outcome & Validation</h2>
      <ul>
        The completed system demonstrated reliable autonomous depth measurement through closed-loop buoyancy control. 
        The robot consistently descended, detected the bottom, resurfaced autonomously, and recovered onboard data across repeated trials. 
        The vehicle was validated to a maximum depth of 17 ft with no water ingress and consistent sensor performance,
        earning the Most Technical Project award for system complexity and execution.
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Engineering Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing stable feedback control in real-world fluid environments requires careful handling of nonlinear dynamics and sensor uncertainty.</li>
        <li>System-level integration — not individual subsystems — ultimately determines reliability in autonomous hardware.</li>
        <li>Robust mission logic and failure handling are as critical as mechanical and control design in untethered systems.</li>
      </ul>
